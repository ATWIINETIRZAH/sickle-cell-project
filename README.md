Sickle Cells Project: SickleVision

Overview

The Sickle Cells Project is a comprehensive application designed to analyze and visualize sickle cell disease (SCD) data using advanced machine learning techniques. The project integrates both front-end and back-end technologies to provide insightful visualizations and predictive models for sickle cell diagnosis and management.

Features

Data Processing & Analysis: Uses Pandas and NumPy for handling and analyzing medical datasets.
Machine Learning Models: Implements predictive models using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
Visualization: Generates insightful graphs with Matplotlib and Plotly.
Web Application: A React.js-based frontend for easy interaction and visualization.
Backend Services: Flask and Next.js/Node.js handle API endpoints and data processing.
Database Management: Stores and retrieves patient and test data using MySQL.
